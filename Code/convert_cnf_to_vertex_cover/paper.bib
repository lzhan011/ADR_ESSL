abstract="This paper introduces a new form of type expressions which represent partial type information. These expressions are meant to capture the type information statically derivable from heterogeneous objects. The new monotypes form a lattice of subtypes and require type inference based on inclusion constraints. We discuss the existence and form of principle types under this extension and present a semi-decision procedure for the well-typing problem which can be restricted to a form that terminates for most practical programs. The partial type information derivable for heterogeneous entities is not sufficient to guarantee type-correctness for many of their uses. We therefore introduce a notion of statically generated dynamic type checks. Finally, all these elements are pulled together to sketch the derivation of a static system for ``plausibility checking'' which identifies the applications which may require a dynamic check and catches many type errors.",

abstract="We study union types and recursive types in the setting of a gradually typed lambda calculus. Our goal is to obtain a foundational account for languages that enable recursively defined data structures to be passed between static and dynamically typed regions of a program. We discuss how traditional sum types are not appropriate for this purpose and instead study a form of ``true'' union in the tradition of soft typing (Cartwright and Fagan, 1991) and occurrence typing (Tobin-Hochstadt and Felleisen, 2008). Regarding recursive types, our formulation is based on the axiomatization of subtyping by Brand and Henglein (1998).",

abstract="TypeScript is a typed extension of JavaScript that has become widely used. More than 2000 JavaScript libraries now have publicly available TypeScript declaration files, which allows the libraries to be used when programming TypeScript applications. Such declaration files are written manually, however, and they are often lagging behind the continuous development of the libraries, thereby hindering their usability. The existing tool tscheck is capable of detecting mismatches between the libraries and their declaration files, but it is less suitable when creating and evolving declaration files.",

abstract="This paper explores the surprisingly rich design space for the simply typed lambda calculus with casts and a dynamic type. Such a calculus is the target intermediate language of the gradually typed lambda calculus but it is also interesting in its own right. In light of diverse requirements for casts, we develop a modular semantic framework, based on Henglein's Coercion Calculus, that instantiates a number of space-efficient, blame-tracking calculi, varying in what errors they detect and how they assign blame. Several of the resulting calculi extend work from the literature with either blame tracking or space efficiency, and in doing so reveal previously unknown connections. Furthermore, we introduce a new strategy for assigning blame under which casts that respect traditional subtyping are statically guaranteed to never fail. One particularly appealing outcome of this work is a novel cast calculus that is well-suited to gradual typing.",

abstract = {Many general-purpose, object-oriented scripting languages are dynamically typed, which provides flexibility but leaves the programmer without the benefits of static typing, including early error detection and the documentation provided by type annotations. This paper describes Diamondback Ruby (DRuby), a tool that blends Ruby's dynamic type system with a static typing discipline. DRuby provides a type language that is rich enough to precisely type Ruby code we have encountered, without unneeded complexity. When possible, DRuby infers static types to discover type errors in Ruby programs. When necessary, the programmer can provide DRuby with annotations that assign static types to dynamic code. These annotations are checked at run time, isolating type errors to unverified code. We applied DRuby to a suite of benchmarks and found several bugs that would cause run-time type errors. DRuby also reported a number of warnings that reveal questionable programming practices in the benchmarks. We believe that DRuby takes a major step toward bringing the benefits of combined static and dynamic typing to Ruby and other object-oriented languages.},
